# Markdown & Github

## First Steps Toward learning Modern Digital Practices for Sustainable and Shareable Research

### December 12, 2017

For the December 12 workshop we are hoping to get the whole WhatEvery1Says team working with a common set of tools, and this will require everyone to install two pieces of software on their computer **before the workshop**.

### Visual Studio Code (AKA "VS Code")

Visual Studio Code is a code editor. It many programming and markup languages, but we will be using it primarily for Markdown. If you already use another code editor and you are happy with it, you do not have to install VS code. However, for simplicity, all WhatEvery1Says workshops and tutorial instructions will assume the use of VS Code. To install it and configure it for use with Markdown, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installer and install it.
1. Launch the application. In the `File` menu, select `Preferences > Color Scheme`. Choose the color scheme you prefer.
1. In the `View` menu, select `Extensions`. Search for and install "markdownlint" extension. Once it is installed, you may have to click a button marked `Reload`. Close the Extensions sidebar by dragging the sidebar border to the left.

### GitHub

To get some hands-on experience with GitHub, we will play with a sandbox repository set up for this workshop.

1. To use GitHub, you must have a GitHub account. If you already have one, skip to step 2. To create an account, go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and follow the instructions.
1. Make sure that you are logged into your GitHub account. Go to [https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github](https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github). At the top of the screen, click the "Star" button. This will provide easy access to your username so that you can be added as a collaborator to the workshop sandbox repository.
1. Finally, download the [GitHub Client](https://desktop.github.com/) installer and install it on your system.

More material will be added soon...
