# Markdown & Github

## First Steps Toward learning Modern Digital Practices for Sustainable and Shareable Research

### Tuesday December 12, 2017, 12-3pm (Feel free to bring your lunch), UCSB South Hall 2509

### [Registration](https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github#registration-1)

The Mellon Foundation funded WhatEvery1Says project at UCSB (WE1S) will be holding the first in its series of workshops open to the UCSB community on "Markdown & Github: First Steps Toward learning Modern Digital Practices for Sustainable and Shareable Research."

First developed in 2004, Markdown is gaining in popularity because it is easy to write and read, as well as to create consistent formatting that can be rendered in a wide variety of formats and environments, including GitHub.

Widely used for computer code, GitHub is becoming increasingly popular with humanities scholars needing these features, and even for hosting blogs and websites.

Across the disciplines, including in the social sciences and humanities, researchers are using these tools to create research environments that enable the maintenance of stable, easy-to-migrate documents, the clear versioning of their work, and the ability to contribute to and draw from shared-project resources.

**Scott Kleinman**, one of the WE1S project's PIs, will lead the workshop. A professor of English at California State University, Northridge, Kleinman is also project lead for the Lexomics project, which produces the online text-analysis tool Lexos.

The workshop is geared for beginners, including students and faculty. It will also serve the purpose of helping to train some of WE1S's research assistants in methods used by the project.

## Registration

**Please bring your laptop to the workshop!!!**

Members of the WhatEver1Says Project team should install two pieces of software on their computer **before the workshop**, instructions for which are given in the [Preparing for the Workshop](https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github#preparing-for-the-workshop) section below. Clicking the "Star" button as discussed in step 2 under GitHub will register you for the workshop.

Participants who are not members of the WhatEver1Says Project team are encouraged to register by the same procedure outlined in the [Preparing for the Workshop](https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github#preparing-for-the-workshop) section. If you do not wish to install anything on your computer or create GitHub account, you will not be able to join in the hands-on training, but you are welcome to sit in on the workshop. In this case, please register by emailing [contact@we1s.ucsb.edu](mailto:contact@we1s.ucsb.edu).

## Preparing for the Workshop

To get the most out of the workshop, please install Visual Studio Code and the GitHub Client software on your computer before the workshop. Installation instructions are given below.

### Visual Studio Code (AKA "VS Code")

Visual Studio Code is a code editor. It can be used for many programming and markup languages, but we will be using it primarily for Markdown. If you already use another code editor and you are happy with it, you do not have to install VS code. However, for simplicity, all WhatEvery1Says workshops and tutorial instructions will assume the use of VS Code. To install it and configure it for use with Markdown, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installer and install it.
1. Launch the application. In the `File` menu, select `Preferences > Color Scheme`. Choose the color scheme you prefer.
1. In the `View` menu, select `Extensions`. Search for and install "markdownlint" extension. Once it is installed, you may have to click a button marked `Reload`. Close the Extensions sidebar by dragging the sidebar border to the left.

### GitHub

To get some hands-on experience with GitHub, we will play with a sandbox repository set up for this workshop.

1. To use GitHub, you must have a GitHub account. If you already have one, skip to step 2. To create an account, go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and follow the instructions.
1. Make sure that you are logged into your GitHub account. Go to [https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github](https://github.com/whatevery1says/workshops/tree/master/markdown_and_github). At the top of the screen, click the "Star" button. This will provide easy access to your username so that you can be added as a collaborator to the workshop sandbox repository.
1. Finally, download the [GitHub Client](https://desktop.github.com/) installer and install it on your system.
